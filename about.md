# About the Mark Protocol

The Mark Protocol is built on several core principles.

## Privacy First

- **No user tracking** - Servers do not log IP addresses or user agents.
- **No cookies** - Stateless by design.
- **Minimal logging** - Only what is needed for security.
- **Anonymous by default** - Authentication grants capability, not identity.

## Security Minded

- **QUIC transport** - Encryption mandatory (TLS 1.3).
- **Capability-based auth** - Tokens grant specific permissions.
- **Versioning** - Complete audit trail of all changes.
- **No client-side execution** - Markdown content only.

## Distributed Preservation

Every reader is a potential mirror:

1. Content is cached locally when you read it.
2. You can re-host content from your cache.
3. Censorship is difficult because content persists.
4. Like Git for documents.

## Anti-Commercialization

- No tracking hooks or analytics
- No ad injection points
- Public domain specification
- Open source implementation
- Anyone can run a server
