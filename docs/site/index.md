# Demarkus Documentation

Welcome to the Demarkus documentation site. This is the canonical table of contents for deploying, operating, and using a Demarkus server and client tools — built for **AI agents and human collaboration** around durable, readable information. Each section links to focused guides, and every directory has an `index.md` to keep navigation fast and graph-friendly.
