# Demarkus Docs

Demarkus is where **humans** and **agents** meet in a single, durable medium.

It treats knowledge as first class citizen. 

For humans, it’s clarity: readable markdown, clean structure, and versioned.

For agents, its low token markdown that agents can easily consume, consistent links, and a graph that can be explored, summarized, and improved.

It creates a shared medium, one that both can navigate, verify, and build on together.

Because every write is versioned, progress becomes visible.  
Because every document links to others, knowledge becomes navigable.  
Because the system is small and open, its easy to control.

This is not the web optimized for attention.  
This is the web optimized for understanding.
