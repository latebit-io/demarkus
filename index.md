- [Agent install brief](/agent-install/)

## What you can do

- Serve documents over `mark://` with a QUIC transport
- Keep immutable version history with auditability
- Use capability tokens instead of account-based identity
- Access content from CLI, TUI, and MCP tools

## Purpose

Demarkus exists to make long-lived knowledge easy to publish, verify, and reuse.

### Example use cases

- **demarkus-soul**: an AI agent's persistent memory across sessions (architecture, roadmap, debugging notes, journal, thoughts)
- **Team operating docs**: internal runbooks and decision logs with version history
- **Public protocol docs**: specs and guides served as plain markdown without ad-tech overhead
- **Research notebooks**: personal or shared notes that remain portable and mirrorable

## Setup

Demarkus supports multiple setup patterns depending on your goals:

- Local solo setup for personal notes and experiments
- Public docs server for open documentation
- Private team knowledge base with token-based access
- `demarkus-soul` for long-lived agent memory
- Hybrid public/private deployment model
